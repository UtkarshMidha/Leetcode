// This question is based on combinatrics. 

// Lets assume that we have p pigs which can give us the accurate result. Now we have
// total Round of test = (timetoTest/TimetoDie) ie. T tests. 

// So for each T test there can be T+1  outcomes that is it can die in 1st or 2nd or Tth oit it means the T cases and the last case is it won't die! So total T+1 Outcomes are possible.

// Now for each pig we have to go for T+1 outcomes i.e
// (T+1)*(T+1)........*(T+1).

// So T+1 tests rounds are there so for all p pigs the total combination will be (T+1) to the power p i.e (T+1)^p. Now** this total combination should be greater than or equal to N.**

// Hence  the condition for the answer is going to be 
// (T+1)^p >= N
// Taking log on both sides we will get the required answee
// p >= log(N)/ log(T+1);
// and hence ceil function is used in the return.
